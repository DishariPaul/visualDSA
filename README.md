# DSA Concept Visualizer - VisualDSA
An interactive Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Visualizer** built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.  
This project focuses on visually demonstrating how core data structures work internally through user-driven operations and step-by-step traversal.

The goal of this project is to strengthen conceptual understanding of DSA topics by bridging the gap between theory and visualization.

## 🎯 Motivation
As a 2nd-year Computer Science student, I built this project to:
- Improve my understanding of DSA concepts
- Visualize how operations and traversals work internally
- Practice JavaScript through a real, logic-driven project
- Develop problem-solving and debugging skills

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Speed control for traversal animations
- Pause / resume traversal
- Level-order traversal (BFS)
- Graph and sorting algorithm visualizations
- Modular code structure
